# Artificial-Intelligence-Implementation-Methodology 
Repository for all things related to the Artificial Intelligence Implementatin Methodology (AIIM) Framework

There are three parts to this project: 

1. Scoping Review of AI implementation research literature
Search PubMed, Google Scholar, and other online databases for AI implementation literature
Limit search to articles in English, published 2010-2021, describe implementation methods of AI applications in health care. Specifically, the methods and frameworks for implementation, the type of data collected, terminology used to describe the implementation, and outcomes reported. 
  - See Scoping_Review_Search_Strategy
  - See .pdf and .xlsx files containing Bollean phrases for the search results

2. Interview AI experts and clinician that use AI in clinical practice
Interview a minimum of n=10 clinicians using AI in their routine clinical practice. Ask them to provide insights into the implementation, workflow changes, and
their beliefs and attitudes towards the implementationa and deployment of AI applications. The interviews will be conducted over the phone or through email.

3. Solicit feedback 
We will put together an expert panel (n=5) on AI implementation. The expert panel will be asked to review the initial draft of the AIIM and provide feedback. 
The feedback from each expert will be shared anonymously with the other panel members. 2-3 rounds (or more) of iterative feedback will be collected from the expert panel, until there is consensus on key concepts and terminology for the AIIM.
