# Artificial-Intelligence-Implementation-Methodology 
Repository for all things related to the Artificial Intelligence Implementation Methodology (AIIM) Scoping Review

There are six steps to this project: 

## Step 1. Identify the research question
The research question for the scoping review is broad in scope and clearly defined: 
  1a) What methods are used to implement AI interventions for cancer care? 
  1b) What outcomes are being measured? 
  1c) What level is the AI intervention being implemented? 
  1d) What stage of implementation did the AI intervention achieve?

## Step 2. Identify relevant studies. 
Search PubMed, Google Scholar, and other online databases for AI interventions in cancer care settings
  - See Scoping_Review_Search_Strategy

## Step 3. Study selection. 
The inclusion and exclusion criteria will be applied after all relevant literature has been identified.
Plan to limit search to articles in English, published 2010-2022, describe AI interventions in cancer care settings, include enough detail to extract and chart data from

## Step 4. Chart the data. 
The relevant data points will be extracted and charted from included studies. This process will extract key data points into a ‘data charting’ database. 
  
  Example below
  
 **Study:** Steiner DF, MacDonald R, Liu Y, Truszkowski P, Hipp JD, Gammage C, Thng F, Peng L, Stumpe MC. Impact of deep learning assistance 
      on the histopathologic review of lymph nodes for metastatic breast cancer. The American journal of surgical pathology. 2018 Dec;42(12):163
     **Setting:** Three cancer clinics 
     **Population:**  Six pathologists reviewed 70 digitized slides from lymph node sections
     **AI Intervention:** Deep learning model to assist pathologists reviewing lymph nodes images for metastatic breast cancer		 	 	 	
     **Methodology:** Multireader, multicase study of pathologists using deep learning algorithm, LYmph Node Assistant (LYNA), to review hematoxylin and 
      eosin (H&E)-stained lymph node images for breast cancer metastasis; Unassisted vs Assisted (the deep learning algorithm was used to identify and 
      outline regions with high likelihood of containing tumor)
      **Outcomes:** Obviousness Score (subjective difficulty of image review), Classification Accuracy (sensitivity/Specificity), Efficiency (review time)
      **Level of Intervention** (patient, provider, clinic, health system, community): provider
      **Implementation Stage** (exploration, installation, initial implementation, full implementation): Exploration
     
## Step 5. Collate and summarize. 
The findings will be reported in a narrative style to contextualize the findings. The goal is to summarize the literature that was reviewed with no regard for the “weight” of the evidence or the quality of the studies. The narrative summary will capture the nature and distribution of study type, range of AI applications, and geographic location, including a summary table of the key data points by study. The literature review will summarize the research gaps and provide definitions and concepts for practitioners to evaluate.

## Step 6. Consultation with outside stakeholders. 
The findings of the scoping review will be provided to a group of at least five outside stakeholders who will provide feedback. The stakeholders may include experts in the field (study authors), leaders of professional societies, and managers and practitioners from local organizations (SLCVHA, UU Health, HCI). Depending on the feedback provided, additional searches may be conducted to further develop any emerging themes found in the literature.
