Methods for Research Evidence Synthesis: The Scoping Review Approach 
https://www.journalofhospitalmedicine.com/jhospmed/article/202729/hospital-medicine/methods-research-evidence-synthesis-scoping-review


Step 1: Identify the research question

  What methods are used to implement AI in health care settings?
    Do these methods follow any frameworks or theories?
  What are the key concepts, domains, and terminology found in the AI implementation research literature?

Step 2: Identify relevant studies
  
  PudMed MeSH Terms: "artificial intelligence"[MeSH Terms] OR artificial intelligence[Text Word]
                     "translational medical research" [

  Boolean search: ("artificial intelligence") AND ("implementation" OR "adoption" OR "deploy") 

Step 3: Study selection

Step 4: Chart the data

Step 5: Collate, summarize, and report the results

Step 6: Consultation exercise
