https://www.journalofhospitalmedicine.com/jhospmed/article/202729/hospital-medicine/methods-research-evidence-synthesis-scoping-review

### Scoping review for implementation methods used for AI in health care settings ###

## Step 1: Identify the research question

  What methods are used to implement AI in health care settings?
    Do these methods follow any frameworks or theories?
  What are the key concepts, domains, and terminology found in the AI implementation research literature?

## Step 2: Identify relevant studies
  
  PudMed MeSH Terms: "artificial intelligence"
  *See MeSH notes    "translational medical research"
  at bottom*         "diffusion of innovation"
                     "informatics"
                     "health services research"
                     "methods"
                    
  Boolean search: ("artificial intelligence") AND ("implementation science" OR "translational medical research") AND ("methods") 
                   PubMed: 49 Results
                  ("methodology" OR "methods") AND ("implementation science" OR "translational medical research") AND ("artificial intelligence")
                   Google Scholar (2010-2020): 2,430 results
                   ("artificial intelligence") AND ("implementation science" OR "translational medical research") AND ("methods")
                   U of U Eccles Health Sciences Library Catalog: 401 results
                   
## Step 3: Study selection

  Inclusion criteria: English language articles
                      Published between 2010-2021
                      Describes the methods and results from implementation of AI application in health care setting
                      Observational studies - longitudinal, cross-sectional, non-randomized
                      Experimental studies - randomized controlled trials
                      Hybrid-effectiveness studies
                      Qualitative studies examining the barriers and facilitators to AI implementation
                      
  Exclusion critera: Studies only reporting on usability testing or user design
                     Studies only reporting on the development of the AI application
                     Studies without a methods section

## Step 4: Chart the data

  The key concepts, domains, and temrinology will be extracted and summarized in a study matrix. The study matrix will help identify overlap between concepts, domains, and
  terminology from the included studies. 

## Step 5: Collate, summarize, and report the results
  
  The results will be summarized in a table and reported in a publication.

## Step 6: Consultation exercise
  
  The final results will be provided to experts in the field to get feedback on the findings. 



### Scoping review for relevant theories, frameworks, and models from other fields ###

## Step 1: Identify the research question

  What other theories, frameworks, and models from quality improvement, health equity, and design process thinking are relevant to AI implementation in health care?
  Are there other methodlogical frameworks in these fields?

## Step 2: Identify relevant studies
 
  PubMed MeSH terms: "quality improvement"
  *See MeSH notes    "user-centered design"
   at bottom*        "learning health system"
                     "healthcare disparities"
                     "health equity"
                     
## Step 3: Study selection

  Inclusion criteria: English language articles
                      Published between 2010-2021
                      Focused on frameworks, theories, and models from quality improvement, health equity, and design process thinking
               
## Step 4: Chart the data                    
 Develop study matrix of relevant frameworks, theories, and models including the kep concepts, domains, and terminology used

## Step 5: Collate, summarize, and report the results
  The results will be summarized in a table and be used in the development of the AIIM

## Step 6: Consultation exercise
  The final results will be provided to experts in the field to get feedback on the findings
